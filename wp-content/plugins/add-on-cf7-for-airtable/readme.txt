Connect the WordPress plugin Contact Form 7 to Airtable. This reliable add-on enables you to integrate your Contact Form 7 forms so that when users submit a form entry, the entries get directly added to Airtable.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is Airtable? =
Offered in SaaS mode, Airtable is a database tool that can be used to create a simple online form as well as a project management environment or even a custom CRM. Equipped with an automatic translation function, the tool manages multiple views: maps, calendars, Kanban boards, Gantt charts, etc.

= Why do I need a Airtable account? =
The Airtable add-on for Gravity Forms uses the Airtable API to link columns with fields and send data. Creating an account on Airtable is free. Once connected, you can get the API key [on this page](https://airtable.com/account).

= Do I have to pay to use the add-on and use Airtable? =
The Contact Form 7 Airtable add-on is completely free.
Airtable offers a free plan for an unlimited number of databases and for small teams of up to 5 people. You will be able to add up to 1200 entries in each database and 2 GB of attachments.
Depending on your needs, several paid subscriptions allow you to unlock these limitations while giving access to more advanced features ([see prices](https://www.airtable.com/pricing)).

= How are my fields synchronized? =
You don't have to do anything, the synchronization is automatic. Make sure you have created your databases and Airtable columns names before linking them to your form fields.

= Why don't I get the Airtable column names in a drop-down list? =
You must enter the names of your columns rather than choosing them from a list because once your fields are linked, if you want to modify, add or delete links, Airtable has a somewhat restrictive handling. We preferred to offer you this solution, more simple, more direct, more scalable and more malleable!
